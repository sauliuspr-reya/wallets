Wallets App

Overview

The Wallets App is a decentralized application designed for managing Ethereum-based wallets securely and efficiently. It offers features for balance checking, transaction signing, and wallet management, all while adhering to modern development practices and leveraging cutting-edge technologies like Next.js 14, ShadCN UI, and AWS services.

High-Level Architecture

Core Features
	1.	Wallet Management:
	•	Securely store and manage private keys using AWS Secrets Manager and KMS.
	•	Group and tag wallets for better organization.
	•	Perform cryptographic operations (e.g., signing) in a secure environment.
	2.	Balance Checking:
	•	Retrieve Ethereum wallet balances via ethers.js.
	•	Expose balance data through an API developed in Next.js.
	3.	Transaction Signing:
	•	Sign and send Ethereum transactions securely.
	•	Use NATS.io JetStream for asynchronous message handling.
	4.	UI Management:
	•	Frontend developed with Next.js 14 and ShadCN UI.
	•	Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling.
	5.	Cloud-Native Deployment:
	•	Deploy services on EKS Kubernetes pods.
	•	Manage secrets and configurations using Kubernetes Secrets.

Component Overview

Component	Responsibility
Secrets Service	Securely handle secrets (e.g., private keys) with AWS Secrets Manager & KMS.
Wallet Manager	Manage private keys, perform signing, and handle cryptographic operations.
Balance Service	Fetch and expose Ethereum wallet balances through APIs.
Frontend	Provide a user-friendly interface for wallet and transaction management.

Development Plan

Phase 1: Foundation Setup
	1.	Initialize the monorepo with Lerna and pnpm.
	2.	Create foundational packages:
	•	secrets (AWS Secrets Manager integration).
	•	wallet-manager (Private key management).
	•	balance-service (Ethereum API integration).
	•	frontend (UI with Next.js and ShadCN UI).
	3.	Set up CI/CD pipelines for building, testing, and deploying.

Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation
	1.	Secrets Service:
	•	Implement functions for retrieving, storing, and updating secrets.
	•	Integrate with AWS KMS for encryption.
	2.	Wallet Manager:
	•	Create signing logic.
	•	Fetch keys securely from the Secrets Service.
	3.	Balance Service:
	•	Develop API endpoints for wallet balance retrieval.
	•	Use ethers.js for Ethereum integration.

Phase 3: Frontend Development
	1.	Build the wallet management UI.
	2.	Integrate APIs for balance display and transaction management.
	3.	Add grouping and tagging functionality for wallets.

Phase 4: Deployment
	1.	Create Kubernetes manifests for each service.
	2.	Deploy services to EKS Kubernetes pods.
	3.	Set up monitoring and logging.

Phase 5: Finalization
	1.	Write comprehensive documentation.
	2.	Perform security audits and optimizations.
	3.	Launch the application.
